          <h1 className={styles.title}>Subjective Thermo-Currency: Energy-based Economy</h1>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            Subjective Thermo-Currency (STC) is a novel concept in currency and economic exchange that fundamentally departs from traditional monetary systems like fiat money and cryptocurrencies. Developed by BrainBoost Ltd., STC is rooted in the principles of physics and utilizes the energy inherent in physical processes as its basis for value. This groundbreaking approach involves integrating virtual artificial glands, or "BodyParts," into the human body as software constructs. These glands measure and store the energy exerted and absorbed by users in real-time, effectively turning human energy expenditure into a quantifiable and transferable currency.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            The key innovation in STC is its reliance on the laws of thermodynamics, ensuring that the currency's value is both stable and sustainable. By aligning economic activity with physical energy exchange, STC aims to address issues of scarcity and security inherent in traditional financial systems. This model not only ensures fairness in transactions but also promotes a more equitable and efficient global economy by leveraging ubiquitous and measurable resources like thermal energy.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            Moreover, STC represents a philosophical shift towards harmonizing human economic activities with natural laws, potentially leading to a more balanced and just society. The technology underpinning STC includes the use of specialized devices to visualize and manage these virtual glands, making the concept both practical and revolutionary in its implications for future economic systemsâ€‹.

        <section className={styles.patentsSection}>
          <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Patented Technologies</h2>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            Subjective Thermo-Currency (STC) introduces several patented technologies that enable its unique functionality and distinguish it from other currency models discussed in the scientific literature. Here are the key patented technologies and their novel contributions:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li className={styles.listItem}>
              <strong>Knowledge Hooks (KnowledeHooks):</strong> This is the patented technology that enable us to implemment our Subjective Thermo-Currency.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              <strong>Virtual Artificial Glands (BodyParts):</strong> These are software constructs integrated into the human body, designed to measure and store the energy exerted by users in real-time. The virtual glands are placed strategically on the hands and shoulders and function as energy transducers.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              <strong>Subjective Semantizer:</strong> Although primarily associated with educational transformation, the Subjective Semantizer also plays a role in the STC framework. It interprets and "semantizes" information, turning written knowledge into intuitive subjective experiences that enhance cognitive processes.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              <strong>Real-Time Energy Transduction and Storage:</strong> The energy measured by the virtual glands is stored in a virtual heart, which acts as a sophisticated battery. This battery mathematically quantifies the accumulated energy, ensuring a fair and secure system of value exchange.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            In summary, Subjective Thermo-Currency leverages advanced technologies that integrate human physiological energy measurement with real-time data processing to create a stable, secure, and sustainable currency model. This innovative approach not only challenges traditional economic systems but also offers a more equitable and efficient alternative.
