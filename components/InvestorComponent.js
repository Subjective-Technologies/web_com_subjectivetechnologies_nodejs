        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Transfer Limitations:</b> Transferring crypto-assets to fiat bank accounts is often not seamless. Users face hurdles such as exchange fees, transfer delays, and regulatory checks. This lack of seamless integration between crypto and fiat systems hinders the practicality and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Resource Misallocation:</b> The complexity and inefficiencies inherent in these systems divert significant intellectual and financial resources. Instead of solving pressing global issues like poverty, healthcare, and environmental degradation, a considerable amount of human effort and talent is spent on navigating and optimizing these convoluted financial systems.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Economic Inefficiencies:</b> The layered fee structures and operational inefficiencies lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers alike. These inefficiencies can stifle economic growth and innovation, as more resources are spent on transaction costs rather than productive investments.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Trust and Transparency Issues:</b> With multiple entities involved in each transaction, ensuring trust and transparency becomes challenging. Users often lack visibility into how their transactions are processed and which entities are involved, leading to mistrust and potential fraud.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Scams and Fraud:</b> The complexity and lack of transparency in Third-Person financial systems create opportunities for scams and fraud. Phishing attacks, Ponzi schemes, and fraudulent investment opportunities exploit the vulnerabilities of these systems, leading to significant financial losses for individuals and businesses.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Organized Crime:</b> The anonymity and lack of traceability in certain financial transactions, particularly with cryptocurrencies, can facilitate organized crime. Criminal organizations use these channels for money laundering, financing illegal activities, and avoiding detection by authorities.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Violence and Exploitation:</b> Financial crimes linked to Third-Person account systems can escalate into violence and exploitation. For example, money laundering operations often fund human trafficking, drug cartels, and other violent criminal enterprises, perpetuating cycles of violence and exploitation.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Identity Theft:</b> The reliance on user input and personal information in financial transactions increases the risk of identity theft. Criminals can steal personal data to access bank accounts, commit fraud, and ruin victims' financial standing.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Pointless Professions</h3>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Our current economic model, influenced by Third-Person currency mechanisms, often results in various inefficiencies that lead to widespread job dissatisfaction. Many people dislike their jobs, and even those who claim to love their work would likely not pay their employers to work on their days off. These inefficiencies give rise to professions designed to address and patch these systemic issues. While these professions often require intellectual effort and sometimes even the use of mathematics looking scientific, they should not be considered scientific because they are based on false premises. As an example we have reached a point where people study neurolinguistics and the workings of the human mind to scam others and sell people unnecessary products, solely to make money. This represents a significant waste of intellectual effort that could have been directed towards solving real humanity's pressing problems. Professions that are intellectually demanding but do not contribute to solving fundamental issues include lawyers, economics, politics, traders, banks, companies, marketing experts, These professions appeared due to our Third-Person technology ecosystem in order to patch its side effects.  While many of these professions involve intellectual effort and some even mathematical skills, they are not scientific because they do not engage with the observation of the real natural world or seek to understand and solve its inherent problems of humanity using that knowledge.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Lazy People:</b> The concept of laziness is another issue arising from the ecosystem of Third-Person technologies and Third-Person current currency models. Laziness is inherent to our nature; every physical system in the world seeks to expand the least amount of energy possible. Energy is not destroyed but transformed into something else. Consequently, lazy people often find smarter solutions to real-world problems because they aim to minimize their effort. Our bodies, as physical systems, naturally exhibit this tendency towards minimal effort, though few are willing to admit it. Within the framework of Third-Person technologies, laziness is viewed as a vice because it undermines the principle of serving others, even if it goes against your will.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Politics and Ideologies</h3>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Politics is another realm generated by our Third-Person currency model. Both capitalism and communism are products of this model, which does not guarantee fairness in transactions. While one system may have better moral values and performance, the other is often seen as a criminal facade.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>What Are Politicians?</b> A politician is an individual who attempts to mask their own laziness by showcasing the hard work of others, thereby taking credit in front of voters. Regardless of their ideology, every politician will claim to defend freedom, support workers, and advocate for the poor.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Workers:</b> Workers support politicians by paying taxes, believing that politicians pave the way for them to work without being exploited by their bosses. However, when workers become dissatisfied with their low income, which is due in part to taxes and regulations, politicians blame entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>The Poor:</b> Politicians use the poor as a shield when workers criticize them and as a source of votes to ensure their political continuity. They often portray entrepreneurs as villains who exploit workers, claiming they make money without working and taking all the credit at the expense of their employees. This narrative appeals to "lazy" workers by painting the pursuit of profit as something dirty.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>The Politician's Role:</b> Politicians strive to maintain their position by navigating the side effects of Third-Person technology: lack of freedom and hardworking individuals. They attempt to mask the problem of lazinessâ€”an inherent trait of human natureâ€”not as a sin but as a driving force behind automation and improved quality of life.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Our Third-Person current currency model leads to scarcity, and as I usually say, "We cannot pretend to solve the problem of scarcity using a tool that is scarce itself." Politicians hide their laziness by pointing fingers at each other and always claiming to favor the workers. If you criticize a politician's policy, they will always justify it in the name of the poor.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Ideology and Currency Model:</b> Any ideology is born as an attempt to mitigate the side effects of our Third-Person currency model. They all claim to seek freedom and aim to address the problem of scarcity, while accusing others of laziness. In essence, politicians use these narratives to maintain their relevance and power, while the real issues of fairness and efficiency remain unaddressed.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Peopleâ€™s Will:</b> There is no alignment between people's needs. The problem is not poverty or lack of money; the problem is comfort. Many things are consumed that do not make your life easier. You could have a zero balance in your account, but if your life is comfortable, you would not complain.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <b>Laziness:</b> The concept of laziness is another issue generated by the entire ecosystem of Third-Person technologies and currency models. Laziness is our real selves; every physical system in the world always seeks the least energy possible. Energy is not destroyed but transformed into something else. Lazy people tend to find smarter solutions to real-world problems because they want to work as little as possible. Our bodies are physical systems as well, so we will always be "lazy people," though nobody likes to admit it. In terms of Third-Person technology, laziness is a sin because nobody would serve anybody else.
        </p>

          <b>Politics:</b> Politics is another realm affected by our Third-Person currency model. Capitalism and communism, which are not opposites, are both products of our Third-Person currency model. The work of politicians is always an attempt to solve the problem of laziness, which is not a sin but nature, driving automation and improved life quality. Our currency model leads to scarcity, and "we cannot pretend to solve the problem of scarcity using a tool that is scarce by itself." Politicians hide their laziness by pointing fingers at each other and always favor the workers. If you attack a policy of a politician, they will always justify it because of the poor. Any ideology, a product of our currency model, seeks freedom and aims to solve scarcity, all while accusing others of laziness.

        <p className={styles.text}>
          The limitations and challenges posed by Third-Person technologies are extensive, affecting various aspects of daily life, from personal well-being and security to environmental sustainability and social equality. Subjective Technologies offer a transformative approach to address these issues, providing more intuitive, secure, and inclusive solutions. This paradigm shift not only enhances individual experiences but also contributes to a more equitable, efficient, and sustainable future. Imagine if all the intellectual effort currently spent on navigating these complex systems could instead be directed towards solving humanity's most pressing issues â€“ the potential for positive change is immense.
